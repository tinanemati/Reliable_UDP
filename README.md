# Computer Networks Project

## Reliable and Congestion Control Data Transfer over UDP 
The goal of this project is to create a reliable version of UDP which is resistant to network congestion. The project is divided into three different parts to help you slowly build towards the reliable, connection oriented and congestion controlled UDP Berryessa.
1. Adding Connection Support to UDP (UDP Putah)
2. Adding Reliability to our UDP Putah (UDP Solano) 
3. Adding Congestion Control to UDP Solano (UDP Berryessa)
